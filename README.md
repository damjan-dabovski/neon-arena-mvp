# Neon Arena

## What is Neon Arena?
A Cyberpunk-themed turn-based arena shooter multiplayer game designed originally for tabletop.

## How do you do a turn-based shooter? You mean like Frozen Synapse?
Players plan out their turns simultaneously in secret and then reveal and perform their actions. Think of it like rock-paper-scissors, but with running and gunning instead.

## Is this a PC game?
The target platform is primarily PC, but there's a very strong case for a mobile release, too. For the initial MVP, the game will be browser-based, primarily for ease of access and testing.

## How far along is the development?
The design work is more or less finished, at least for the initial web-based MVP. There is no playable version currently, but development on it has started back up after a brief hiatus.
